**Hufzip** is a text file compressor based on Huffman algorithm. It has a didatic character and was built for the sole purpose of learning about file compressing methods. Files compressed with Huffzip have `.hfz` extension.

## Quick Guide

This is a quick guild to how to run Hufzip on Repl<span>.</span>it.

### Compressing a file

1. Open the [project repl](https://repl.it/@davidsonbrsilva/hufzip);
2. With the editor on focus, press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` on Windows and Linux or `Cmd` + `Shift` + `P` on Mac. A text box should open;
3. Search "Open Shell" and click the option that appears.
4. Type the following command on terminal:
```
$ ./main -c "sample/long.txt"
```
Done! If everything went well, a `long.hfz` file was created on `sample` folder.

### Decompressing a file


1. Open the [project repl](https://repl.it/@davidsonbrsilva/hufzip);
2. With the editor on focus, press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` on Windows and Linux or `Cmd` + `Shift` + `P` on Mac. A text box should open;
3. Search "Open Shell" and click the option that appears.
4. Type the following command on terminal:
```
$ ./main -c "sample/long.txt"
```
All right! If everything went well, a `long.txt` file was created on `sample` folder.

## Building

No makefile was provided for the project. However, it can be built without major complications. The test was performed with MinGW for Windows 64 bits.

## Uso

### Compressing file

Use parameter `-c` parameter, followed by filepath, to compress it. For instance:
```
$ hufzip -c "sample/long.txt"
```

### Decompressing file

Use parameter `-d` parameter, followed by filepath, to decompress it. For instance:
```
$ hufzip -d "sample/long.hfz"
```
